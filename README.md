## Repo Contents
This repo currently contains a script which simulates a turing machine.

Eventually the script will have a webapp frontend but for now it just takes a file containing a turing machine program and a string representation of a turing machine tape.
The script compiles the program into a graph representation then runs the machine on the given tape and outputs the final state and the tape.
